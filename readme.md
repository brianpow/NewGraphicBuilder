# NewGraphBuilder Example #

An excellent graph builder written in Visual Basic 6

The used Typelibs are:
- ActiveMovie Control Typelib (that's the usual one, which is always useful in VB6/DirectShow-contexts)
- MS Video Control 1.0 Typelib (this was offering such nice interfaces as IBaseFilter, IGraphBuilder etc. - so no need to define them in ones own typelib)
- Edanmo's OleInterfaces and functions (for more generic OLE-interactions per IIDs - but also has IPersistStream- and other interfaces, allowing for *.grf loading/saving)
